                    <p>The Samic Ambassador Plan is a Plan that enables people to 
                        Earn on every thing they do on our Official Website <a href="https://www.samicsub.com">Click here to visit the website</a>. <br><br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The Samic Ambassadors Earn Majorly in 4 different ways, you can choose to Earn in just a way or you choose to earn in all the Ways. The Plan is totally Free. Just your Readiness to start making money with what you do.</span>  <br>
                        <br><br>
    1. They Earn based on the Transactions they make
    As a Samic Ambassador, You will enjoy Discount on all the Transactions you make on the Website and you will still earn additional commission for buying as an Ambassador. <br>
    
    For Example, If a Samic Ambassador is to buy the MTN Data 1gb Monthly Subscription. The Normal Price for that is 400 where some even sell these for 450. But as a Samic Ambassador, You will get it for 365 Naira and you will still earn additional 8 Points (Where 1point is equivalent to 3.8 Naira). That means you get additional 30.4 Naira. That's just for the MTN Data, same applies to all the products on the Website
    <br><br>
    2. They earn based on the Transactions of their Downlines
    As a Samic Ambassador, You will be assigned a Referral Link which you can give to people for them to register and you will see it in your dashboard after they register. If any of your downlines now buy data or Airtime or any product from the website, You will get Points for that Immediately. That simply means if you are able to get up to 50+ downlines (The Registration is Free, so it is easier to get) and they all make Transactions in a Day, or let's assume you get 10 points from each, that 500+ points in that day and you've made up to 2k without even doing anything. and the more they make the Transactions the more you earn from them and they may not even be aware. That's the second way on how to Earn
    <br><br>
    3. Referral Bonus (1k each)
    Let's assume out of the 50+ people you are able to refer, Just 20 of them are genuinely ready to also be earning as you are also earning, if they fill the form to be an Ambassador and we approve it (That will be done in less than 24hrs), You will get 1k each from them making 20k without buying anything. 20k just like that. You will get to know more when you join the ambassador's group
    <br><br>
    To the last method of Earning as an Ambassador
    <br>
    4. As a super active samic ambassador (Samic Aggregator)
    Let's assume you are able to get like 120+ downlines and just 100 of these your downlines are able to withdraw in a Particular month, You that you refer them will get a Salary that is different from your Earning (50k), recall, before those 100 can withdraw, you would have got 1k on each, that's 100k and we will still give you additional 50k for managing your downlines to withdraw. If you are still able to have 100 downlines (can also be the formal ones) that withdraw in a particular month, You will still get your Salary.
    <br><br>
    Those are the main 4 ways to Earn, note that you can also sell the products to people and add your own convenient fee or charge.

    <h3>How do you become a Samic Ambassador?</h3>
    <p>
        To Register,
    You need to first become a Member (Free), 
    How do you become a Member??? 
    <br><br>
    There are Basically 2 ways to become a Member, the first one is of lesser advantage,
    <br><br>
    1. If you register with a Referral Link, you will become an Inactive ambassador and you only need to make 3 Data Transactions in order to be eligible to fill the active ambassadors form. Just 3 data Transactions. Use this link for that

    <br><br>
    
    2. The Second way is by visiting the website,<a target="_blank" href="www.samicsub.com">(click here to visit)</a> and click on register with us, fill the form without a Referral number, Here you will just be a Samic member and you will need to make daily Data Transactions for at least a Week in order to be able to Fill the form of Active Ambassadors.
    <br><br><br>
    Those are the 2 ways. The first one is highly Recommended.
